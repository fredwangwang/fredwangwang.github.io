## List of stuff
Recently I am trying to pick up some assembly knowledge. List here all the materials I followed through to gain some basics.

1. https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assembly_programming/assembly_introduction.htm   
Foundametals of programming in [nasm](https://www.nasm.us/doc/) with x86 assembly instructions. It provides online compiler so no assmbler installation is strictly required.
1. https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html  
Review and more details about x86 assembly, include calling conventions.
1. https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/  
Another nasm tutorial, but in x86-64. Introduces SSE2 floating point instructions and x86-64 calling convention.
1. https://www.nasm.us/doc/nasmdo11.html  
Nasm's brief documentation about 64bit assembly. Review the content above.

Also some other stuff might be interesting to go through:
1. https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/introduction-to-x64-assembly/

## But why
> Why learning assembly when you can type `print "hello world!"` in python but doing the same in assembly requires 10s of lines of manipulating raw memory and registers?

Manipulating registers and raw memory? Cool isn't it! Also I'd like to learn a bit about reverse engineering, this gives me groundings. Also hopefully knowing a bit of assembly helps me getting better at using Cheat Engine ðŸ˜ƒ
