If you haven't read the [previous post]({% post_url 2019-08-03-dll-inject %}) and want to have a high level idea about what is manual inject, I recommand you to read it first.

You can download the finished code [here](https://github.com/fredwangwang/MemJect). Feel free to grad a copy and then walk through the content of this post, as the post will not cover the part that is straightforward to understand.

As said in the previous post, the rough processes to manual inject a dll include:
1. Open the DLL file and read its content.
2. Allocate space for the DLL content and the shellcode (resolve imports and excute the 
entrypoint)
3. Copy the DLL content into the allocated space.
4. Copy the shellcode into the allocated space.
5. Excute the shellcode (in a new thread).

The first step is the basic operation to read the content from the file, there is not much to explain in there. ~~So let's jump directly into the second step.~~ Actually before allocating space in the target process, we need to know which is the target process first, surprisingly.

## Find out the target process
In order to find out which is the target process and get a reference of the process, we need to
iterate through all the processes that our injector can list and find the match by its name.
The API `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` can give us a reference to all the processes:
```c
HANDLE processSnapshot = CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS, 0);
```
and then we can iterate through and find out which one is the process we want:
```c
if (Process32First(processSnapshot, &processInfo)) {
	while (Process32Next(processSnapshot, &processInfo)) {
		if (!strcmp(processInfo.szExeFile, PROCESS_NAME)) {
			process = OpenProcess(PROCESS_VM_WRITE | PROCESS_VM_OPERATION | PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD, FALSE, processInfo.th32ProcessID);
			break;
		}
	}
}
```
After iterating and comparing each process name with the target process name, we either get a
reference to the process or the process is not running. If later, we can safely quit. Otherwise we can now do some interesting things to the process.

## Allocate space for the DLL and shellcode.
After obtained the process reference (handle), we can now allocate the space in the target process by calling `VirtualAllocEx`. In the code you can see the following two lines:
```
VirtualAllocEx(process, NULL, ntHeaders->OptionalHeader.SizeOfImage, MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);
```
which is used to allocate memory for the dll image and 
```
VirtualAllocEx(process, NULL, loaderMemSize, MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READ);
```
to allocate memory for the shellcode.

One thing to notice here. The memory allocated for the dll image has permission of `RWX`. It is very easy to understand read and execute permissions, which is standard for executable code memory region, but why do we need write permission? It is because the bits we just copied to the target process memory does not work quite yet. Some modification like relocation needs to happen before the dll can work properly. This is indeed one of the reason why manual map injection can still be detected if the monitoring tool really wants to. They can scan for any memory region marked as `RWX` and extract the memory for further analysis. [Here](http://hooked-on-mnemonics.blogspot.com/p/injdmp.html) is a tool you can try to dump the `RWX` memory regions in a process to detect potential injection.

## Copy the DLL content into the allocated space
When we copy the dll content over to the allocated memory, we don't want to copy over every bits in the dll file. All we need is the header of the dll and the code sections mapped to their relative virtual address:
```c
WriteProcessMemory(process, executableImage, binary, ntHeaders->OptionalHeader.SizeOfHeaders, NULL);

PIMAGE_SECTION_HEADER sectionHeaders = (PIMAGE_SECTION_HEADER)(ntHeaders + 1);
for (int i = 0; i < ntHeaders->FileHeader.NumberOfSections; i++)
	WriteProcessMemory(process, executableImage + sectionHeaders[i].VirtualAddress,
		binary + sectionHeaders[i].PointerToRawData, sectionHeaders[i].SizeOfRawData, NULL);
```
Because the dll file normally containes position-dependent code, the relative memory structure need to be kept the same for the dll to work as expected.

## Copy the shellcode into the allocated space
It gets exiting from here! The image of dll we copied over to the target process wouldn't just work. We need to have a helper guy (shellcode) to fix some stuff in there and eventually call the entrypoint of the dll to get the dll running. In order to have the shellcode to do the work, it needs to know some information. More specifically, it needs to know
- the base address of the dll image in the target process so it knows where to do the work
- `LoadLibraryA`
- `GetProcAddress` 
I will explain why `LoadLibraryA` and `GetProcAddress` are needed later.

Wh can store the information in a struct and then copy it over to the target process, as well as the content of the shellcode so that we can call the shellcode in the target process correctly later:
```c
WriteProcessMemory(process, loaderMemory, &loaderParams, sizeof(LoaderData), NULL);
WriteProcessMemory(process, loaderMemory + 1, shellcode, (DWORD)stub - (DWORD)shellcode, NULL);
```

[//]: # But how do we pass the information to the shellcode? We do it by the function calling convention.
[//]: # 
[//]: # Assume you are calling a function named `func` which takes 3 arguments, the following chart
[//]: # is what actually happening (more or less in the assembly level). So when the function actually executes, it will expect the arguments is stored in the memory address right before it. That's it! We can manually place [//]: # the argument, the information our shellcode needs, right before 
[//]: # 
[//]: # ```
[//]: # -----------------
[//]: # |   push  arg1  |
[//]: # |   push  arg2  |
[//]: # |   push  arg3  |
[//]: # |  jmp to func  |
[//]: # |     func      |
[//]: # |     impl      |
[//]: # |     ....      |
[//]: # |     ....      |
[//]: # -----------------
[//]: # ```

## Excute the shellcode
Now we have all the bits we need in the target process, we can finally execute our shellcode!
```c
CreateRemoteThread(process, NULL, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)(loaderMemory + 1), loaderMemory, 0, NULL);
```
It's gonna be LEGEN, wait for it... DARY!! Your dll is injected, Woo Hoo!

Is it really? Yes, it is, from the injector's point of view.
No, it is not, all the magic just start to happen in the target process... our shellcode

## Shellcode
What does our shellcode needs to do? All the functionality that is provided to us by `LoadLibrary` to make the dll work properly. Specifically:
1. relocation
1. import dependencies
1. execute tls callback (optional, it is not a common feature)
1. call dllmain

I will go in detail about what happens in the shellcode in the next post.



Why relocate?
Because PE format normally contains position-dependent code, as contrast to position-indepent code. This basically means the code has to be placed into the correct virtual memory address in order to have the code working properly, otherwise when the code access the virtual memory address of some data it assumes there, it is not.

So the delta between the prefered address and the actual address is calculated, and then added to the exising memory addresses as needed.

`SizeOfBlock`
> The size of this structure plus all the WORD relocations that follow. To determine the number of relocations in this block, subtract the size of an IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION (8 bytes) from the value of this field, and then divide by 2 (the size of a WORD). For example, if this field contains 44, there are 18 relocations that immediately follow: (44 - sizeof(IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION)) / sizeof(WORD) = 18
